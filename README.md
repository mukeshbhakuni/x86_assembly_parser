# X86 Assembler Parser

It will take nasm 64 bit assembly code as input and generate symbol table, literal table, opcode table, and .lst output for it.

## Getting Started

you can clone the repository  or get it from google drive.

## Prerequisites

you have to install nasm on your machine and will also require gcc compiler.


## Testing


* Run the programme 16105.py as "python 16105.py" as the code is implemented in python.

* Then enter the appropriate nasm assembly file name present in the current directory.

* It will generate the symbol table  ,literal table ,opcode table and .lst file code as output for it. 


## Acknowledgments
